While I currently reside in Huntington Beach, California, I am originaly from the island of Oahu, Hawaii. During my time in the islands, I attended a small private shcool called Maryknoll. Maryknoll Schools has a prominent Catholic history and tradition which instilled a foundation of service, community, and gratitude that I carry with me today.
  After my time there, I was presented with the oportunity to attend the University of Hawaii at Manoa. While working towards a bachelors degree with a music focus I joined the diverse and eclectic campus community. This experience not only reaffirmed my passion for the accademic interests I naturaly had but also broadened by perspective to include many more professional possibilites. One of these new found possibilites was web develpment.
